# Customer-churn-Prediction

Customer churn prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a common approach in data science and can help businesses identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain those customers. Here's an overview of the steps involved in building a customer churn prediction model using ANN:

Data Preprocessing: Start by collecting and preprocessing the customer churn dataset. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Identify relevant features that can help predict customer churn. This may involve analyzing the dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis, and selecting features that have a significant impact on churn prediction. Additionally, you can engineer new features that might improve the predictive power of the model.

Model Architecture: Design the architecture of the ANN model. This includes defining the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions to be used. You can experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Model Training: Train the ANN model using the training dataset. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and relationships between the input features and the churn outcome. The training process involves forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent algorithms to update the model's weights and biases.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics for churn prediction include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analyze the results and fine-tune the model if necessary.
